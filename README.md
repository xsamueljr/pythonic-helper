# A Pythonic helper for Rust

## Why?
Since my first (and main) language is Python, it was a bit shocking for me to find out that functions like `input()` don't exist, so... Why not make a crate that adds them?

## All contributions are welcome!
This is my first time making a public library (yes, even counting Python), so it's small and probably doesn't follow all the good practices. I'm open to feedback, so please feel free to submit an issue or a pull request, I'd be happy to review it
